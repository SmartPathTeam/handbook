# The Gatewood Award

SmartPath believes it's people are it's best advantage as a company. Our culture and company wouldn't be anything without our fantastic employees. While everyone at SmartPath is awesome, we like to specifically recongnize great work when it happens with a special award.

[Emma Gatewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandma_Gatewood), better known as Grandma Gatewood, was the first woman to through hike the Appalachian Trail. She was 67 at the time. She hiked it three more times. She had no previous hiking experience and hiked with almost nothing. By all standards, she would have made a great SmartPather, so we named the award after her. We have the book [Grandma Gatewood's Walk](https://www.amazon.com/Grandma-Gatewoods-Walk-Inspiring-Appalachian/dp/1613734999) all about her story in our office library.
