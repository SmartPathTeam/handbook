# Policies

The following policies outline more details in specific areas, but they generally boil down to: 
**Be smart and treat each other well.** 



## Security

We have a very formal list of Security and Use policies for employees that everyone is required to sign on a year basis through our security tool. A full booklet of these policies can be **[read here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11nJ2_Jx2A0D0NA27SOjVtJTVzdsWogQs/view)**.  

All employees also undergo regular security training. 



## Expenses + Reimbursements

If you’re ever travelling on behalf of SmartPath or need to make a purchase with SmartPath funds, you may do so and submit and expense report here : 

[Reimbursement Form](https://smartpath.typeform.com/to/kzO55K)

If you’re with someone who’s more senior, they should be the one to make the purchase, preferably on their company card. 



#### Travel Per Diem

The below are general guidelines to adhere to. Just because it’s there doesn’t mean you have to use every penny. When in doubt, be reasonable, especially in other cities where prices may be very different than expected.

**Breakfast**: $10
**Lunch**: $10
**Dinner**: $25



## Side Gigs

Working on the side is a great way to dial up extra income and hone other interests or skills. However, we do need to be sure that any side gigs do not come at the expense of SmartPath. Here guidelines to keep in mind:

- **Is this person a SmartPath Client?** Then no other financial offerings or products should ever be sold or offered to them by you.
- **Is what you’re doing competing with SmartPath?** Then don’t do it. Remember part of your employment contract is a non-compete. *If you’re a part-time coach who’s also an independent advisor, this is a fine line, but one we will walk with you.*
- **Is what you’re doing interfering with your SmartPath role?** If this job takes away from your hours and is interfering with your ability to complete your SmartPath work, that’s unacceptable. 
- **Is what you’re doing negatively affecting SmartPath’s brand?** If this job is public facing and involves any illegal or shady activity that would harm SmartPath’s reputation, it’s unacceptable.

Always discuss side gigs with your manager to understand if there is a potential conflict.

Additionally, soliciting clients for any reason is unacceptable. Offering to take services offline or take up a case for a friend or family member is not OK. 



## Gifts

Gifts from partners, vendors, or potential customers or vendors are only permissible within the following parameters:

- Employees are not allowed to accept gifts exceeding $25 value unless it is a shared gift among all employees.
- Gifts of *significant value* must be reported to the COO. 
- Gifts may never be in the form of cash.



## Discipline

SmartPath’s goal is to build a collaborative and supportive environment where careers can flourish. However, if there is misconduct, Smartpath commits to address it justly. A series of steps to assist employees in correcting behavior shall be provided when possible. The discipline process has six steps of increasing severity. These steps are:

1. Verbal warning
2. Informal meeting with supervisor
3. Formal reprimand
4. Formal disciplinary meeting
5. Penalties
6. Termination

Different offenses correspond to different steps in our disciplinary process. For example, minor, one-time offenses will trigger Step 1. More severe violations (e.g. sexual harassment) will trigger Step 6.

Managers are to inform employees when launching a progressive discipline process. Pointing out a performance issue is not necessarily a verbal warning and may be part of regular feedback. 

Managers may skip or repeat steps at their discretion. Certain circumstances may be treated differently from that described in this policy. But, SmartPath shall always be obliged to act fairly and lawfully and document every stage of the progressive discipline process.

SmartPath isn’t obliged to follow the steps of the progressive discipline process outlined above. As an “at-will” employee in the United States, SmartPath may terminate an employee directly, without launching a progressive discipline process. For serious offenses (e.g. sexual harassment), SmartPath may terminate an employee without warning.



## Harassment

SmartPath - its leadership, employees and advisors - will not tolerate any sort of harassment. We are a company of people that aims to humanize and restore dignity to each other, our clients and customers through our work. This does not mean everyone must always agree with everyone, but instead demands we treat people as people, deserving of our respect. 

Harassment or discrimination based on race, color, ethnicity, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender (including gender identity and gender expression), religion, religious creed, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical or mental disability, military and veteran status, genetic information, medical condition, sexual orientation, political affiliation or any other protected class, characteristic, or consideration made unlawful under applicable federal, state, or local laws, is illegal and prohibited. 



## Office Relationships

Love happens. You spend a lot of time at work. Relationships in the office are fine so long as :

1.  One person is not the supervisor (direct or indirect of the other)
2. A professional atmosphere of respect is maintained and performance is not impacted
3. You invite us to the wedding (just kidding… but seriously)
