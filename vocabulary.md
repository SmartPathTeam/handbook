**SmartPath Advisors:** 
SmartPath has a subsidiary fee-only, Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) that allows us to give financial guidance to specific clients (who agree to the RIA terms of service). As much as possible, we tried to make the experience seamless between the two parts of the business (coaching and advising), however there are clear delinations for compliance reasons. 

**OKRs:**
Otherwise known as Object Key-Results, this is the way we align the team around what's important. We currently use a cadence of 6-weeks on and 2-weeks off. Our Objectives are usually the same cycle-to-cycle, but the Key Results always change out to focus on tactics of what matters. [This article](https://medium.com/startup-tools/okrs-5afdc298bc28) is a great overview of OKRs. If you want to go really deep, you can take a look at the [Measure What Matters book](https://www.whatmatters.com/) (we have a copy in our office Library).

**SDIE**: 
Savings. Debt. Income. Expenses. This is our matrix for understanding where someone is in our [7-Tank System](https://www.joinsmartpath.com/blog/2015/02/financial-fuel-the-7-tank-system/).

**7-Tank System and FUEL**
This is the backbone of our financial philosophy that Alok hashed out over years of teaching. If you spend less than you make each month, you have FUEL, and FUEL let's to do stuff (save, payoff debt, buy things, etc.). But the order you do things also matters, and that's what the 7-Tank System is for. [Check it out](https://www.joinsmartpath.com/blog/2015/02/financial-fuel-the-7-tank-system/).
