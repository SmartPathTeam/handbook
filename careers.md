# Careers

We've built SmartPath to be a great place to work, which hopefully means you'll be here for a while. We're a small and growing company, so we don't have everything figured out yet when it comes to careers, but if you're the type of person who likes to solve problems, we're probably already a fit. But, we also know that you may out grow your time here at SmartPath, and that's fine, too.



### Two Tracks

SmartPath believes in a two-track development system: Individual Contributor and Management. To progress in your career, you shouldn't have to manage people. People management is a completely different skillset than individual contribution areas (sales, development, marketing, coaching, etc.), so to assume that just because you're a good Software Developer that you would inherently make a good Software Developer manager is incredibly naive. 

Regardless of which track you're on, there are two areas that primarily determine your level at the company:

1. **Mastery:** 
   Mastery is the measure of which are the subject matter expert of your particular area or areas. In any skill area, you must learn to progressively improve a variety of skills to slowly become *the* master or best-in-class. Each role at SmartPath has different areas of mastery, but all are geared towards incremental improvements until mastery.  
2. **Leadership:**
   Leadership, not management, is also a quality that must be developed to progress in your career. Typically, you move from having your work prescribed to you, to prescribing your own work, to prescribing the work of others. Leaders don't have to be managers, but managers have to be leaders. As you progress in your career, the more others should think of you as a leader.
