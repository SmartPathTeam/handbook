# Benefits

Almost all of these benefits are outlined and facilitated through [Gusto](https://app.gusto.com).



## Health (Full-time only)

SmartPath is excited to provide health benefits to you! Healthy living is important to healthy work. 

### **Medical Insurance**

We currently offer 2 options through **Anthem / Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia**.

[**Traditional POS Plan**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dhgun6LFyOeF-zoEyaYE5hEHHSFcJHJZ/view): 			  $4,000 deductible with $8,200 max out of pocket (for individuals)

[**High Deductible HSA Plan**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D89jbSzdqXpmytE1bY-YwDre6Hsy-s7B/view): 	$6,100 deductible with $7,200 max out of pocket (for individuals)

The HSA plan comes with an HSA account through Gusto that SmartPath contributes $10 / month to. 

There are a lot of nuances to Health Care costs. Please spend enough time reading through each plan to understand what is covered and what is not.

Cost wise, SmartPath provides an allowance equal to 75% of the cost of the Traditional POS Plan for individuals. The allowance is the same for either plan. 

Dependents and family can be added to the plans, but are your responsibility. 



### Eyecare

Eyecare Coverage is through **Guardian**. It covers the basics and is pretty affordable.

## Financial

We’re also fans of financial wellness (surprisingly), so here are the financial benefits we provide:

### 401(k) Matching

SmartPath offers up to a 4% match dollar-for-dollar for any full-time employee over the age of 21 starting on their first day. Plans are powered by [Guideline](https://www.guideline.com/), which offers a strong offering of plan allocations and options, as well as flexibility to change contributions as much as you want. 



### Referral Bonuses

Our team is our greatest asset as a company. As an employee, you are responsible for maintaining our culture and success. You know best the type of people who would help SmartPath succeed. If you know of people who would be a great fit for a position at SmartPath, please let Stuart know who the person is and why they would be a great fit. 

Any referral who is hired and remains at SmartPath for at least 90 days will earn you a cool $1,000 bonus. 



### Financial Coaching

As a financial wellness company, what kind of a workplace would we be if we didn’t offer our own services to our employees? You are welcome to setup 1:1 time with Alok, Ryan, Olivia or any of our Coaches or Advisors to review your financial situation and receive financial advice. 



### Education Stipend

We believe our success lies in the success of our employees. Learning is critical to growing personally and as a company. So we offer **$750** per calendar year per employee to spend on "learning." We define this pretty broadly and can have nothing to do with your role at SmartPath. Learning for fun is still learning. This amount also can be used for professional fees and certifications. 

To use this benefit, you can submit an Expense Reimbursement request through Gusto or work with your manager to use a company card.


### Home-Office Setup Stipend

Now that we all work from home, and plan to for the forseeable future, being comfortable is a must. We offer **$250** per calendar year per employee to spend on your "home office." If you're looking for ideas, headphones, new desk, new chair, second external monitor, home printer, and office decor might help you get started.

To use this benefit, you can submit an Expense Reimbursement request through Gusto or work with your manager to use a company card.


### Parental Leave (Full-time only)

Spending time with new additions to the family is important. Whether you’ve grown your family the old fashioned way or adopted, your attention is now on more important things. You need to focus on your family (and on whatever sleep you can get). Here are the benefits available for new parents: 

| Tenure                         | Benefit                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **0-11 Months with SmartPath** | 12 weeks at 60% pay                 |
| **12+ Months with SmartPath**  | 6 weeks at 100% pay, 6 with 60% pay |

Time off may be taken at any point during the first year after family change. For example, you may choose to stagger your leave due to care responsibilities.

**Gradual Return to Work**: For the first 4 weeks after returning to work after leave, you may opt to work 4 - instead of the usual 5 - days a week while remaining at full pay. Days off should be coordinated with manager.

### Time Off (Full-time only)

Time away from the office and from work is essential for maintaining a healthy perspective and balance. If you wish to take off any work days off outside of the **Company Holidays** identified above, you may do so at your manager’s discretion with adequate warning. There is no allowance or accrual of time off, however we do ask that you request time off in Gusto from the "Time Off" tab. Leadership occasionally reviews time off to monitor for burn-out potential since we know that "unlimited" plans usually lead to less time off than more. 

There are currently no “sick” days provided or tracked outside of applicable states. If you need to take time to get well, do so. If you are sick and can work from home, please do so and don’t bring your germs to the office. Certain states do mandate “sick” pay accrual, and in the particular states, we follow the minimum applicable guidelines, however our policy is more informal as stated above.



### Volunteer Time Off (VTO) (Full-time only)

SmartPath believes in the value of supporting local, national, and international non-profits with our time and talent. Each calendar year, SmartPath offers 2 business days to devote to Volunteer time (16 hours).



### Donation Matching 

SmartPath will match up to $100 per year to any eligible 501(c)(3) nonprofit. This process is managed by Gusto. Simply click on “Giving” from the menu or [click here](https://manage.gusto.com/employee/giving) to get started.
