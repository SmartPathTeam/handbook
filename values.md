## Core Values

### AUTHENTIC

In all that we do, we must be genuine, empathetic human beings. There is no judgement here. Treat all with equality and respect. Don’t sugarcoat and don’t be a jerk. People do amazing things when you believe in them.



### SIMPLE

Jargon sucks. Reducing complexity is hard, but a noble effort. Simple is clear, concise, and connectable. 



### DELIGHTFUL

Love what you do. Enjoy helping others succeed. Know that you are making a tangible difference in people’s lives. 



### ADAPTABLE

Change is constant. Measure what’s important. Always be learning. What is true today may not be true tomorrow, and that is OK.



### TENACIOUS

Use scarcity as your ally, not your enemy. Creatively solve problems. Done is better than best. Our clients don’t care if we ever “make it,” they only care about their finances.
