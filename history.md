# History



### Phase 1: Education

SmartPath started in 2010 when Alok Deshpande left his career at Bain & Co. to teach personal finance.

> “As a result of the financial crisis, many people in the areas I grew up were facing foreclosure, job loss and significant financial stress. I was frustrated by the situation and my wife challenged me to do something about it. So, I quit my job and started teaching people about money. I wrote my own curriculum and had six people in my first class!”

Alok recognized that only 4 of 50 states require financial education to graduate from high school. Moreover, as adults, most families don’t have access to an unbiased financial advisor (they’re selling products). Simply put, the cards are stacked against Main Street families when it comes to financial decisions.

Alok’s approach centered around teaching people about money without selling any financial products. His curriculum was inspired by his mother who came to the US with $8 and ultimately became a millionaire by following two principles:

1. She avoided things she didn’t understand
2. She spent less than she made, every month, for 40 years.

Having lived that playbook, Alok knew that smart choice every day lead to long term wealth. He expanded upon that philosophy and published his own system called Financial Fuel and the 7-Tank System. He published *Fuel: The Most Important Number in Your Financial Life* in the fall of 2015.

###	 Phase 2: An App for that

That fall, Stuart began consulting with Alok on how to productize the 7-Tank System. In the summer, Alok attended Y Combinator in Silicon Valley as he continued work on SmartPath Mobile, a budgeting app. 
Stuart officially joined the team as a co-founder in February 2017 as COO. After several more months of development, the team felt a clear sense that the app alone was not drawing interest. It was Alok’s unique messaging and personality that made personal finance compelling. He also discovered that people really just wanted an unbiased ally to talk to about money. In the Spring of 2017, SmartPath began offering limited pilots with Financial Coaches. The program was raw and needed refinement, but started SmartPath down it’s current journey to give every Main street family unbiased support with money. 

### Phase 3: Coaching and More

In the years since, we've been honing what Financial Coaching looks like and how we offer it. We've also relaunched our mobile app with a very different focus around financial planning and financial insights vs. traditional budgeting. We're still learning and growing and need your help making this part of our story.
